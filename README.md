To use, run `git clone https://github.com/SRF-Audio/utility-scripts.git`

This repo is a list of useful setup scripts for different Linux Distros, and various cloud/kubernetes tools that I use. These allow me to spin up a new VM or container, and quickly bring it back to my preferred configuration.
